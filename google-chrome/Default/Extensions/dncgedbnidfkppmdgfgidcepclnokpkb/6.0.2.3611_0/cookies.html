        <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer or other device when
          mobile applications load on your device or when websites are loaded in a browser,
          including websites that provide online software. Cookies are used to recognize your device
          and to store your preferences. Cookies may store your preferences for a single visit or
          for multiple repeat visits. Some cookies transmit data back to Vernier or third party
          hosts, while others are local storage items that do not transmit any data. Cookies may be
          set by Vernier or by third parties to serve content or provide advertising or analytics
          services on to Vernier

          Please note that the names of cookies and their use can change from time to time as
          necessary to ensure that the App functions as intended and as determined by Vernier or by
          any third party hosts Vernier may choose to work with to provide the App. Vernier is not
          responsible for how third party cookies behave or may change from time to time. You can
          control how cookies, including third party cookies, interact with your browser as
          described in Controlling Cookies below.

        <h2>Controlling Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          The App can be used via website browser, and most browsers provide for ways to control
          cookie behavior, either through built-in functionality or by using third-party plugins.
          You can opt out of accepting cookies by adjusting your browser settings to not accept
          cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. On a mobile device, you can adjust
          your settings to limit ad tracking. Please note that certain features of the App may not
          function if you delete or disable cookies.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Cookie Consent Banner</h2>
        <p>
          You may see a “cookie consent banner” on the App that lists the categories of cookies we
          use and provide you the option to consent to or reject that type of cookie. When you
          consent in this manner, Vernier may set cookies on the App in correspondence with the
          categories of cookies to which you consented. We will display the cookie consent banner to
          you periodically, just in case you change your mind.
